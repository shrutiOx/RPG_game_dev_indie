RPG Game Development
This repository showcases C# scripts written for an educational and portfolio-enhancing game development project. The game will include core combat mechanics, an inventory system, and dialogue functionality.
The purpose of this project is solely for educational and portfolio-enhancement purposes. No part of this game is intended for distribution or monetization.
Once completed, a WebGL link and executable file will be provided here to demonstrate the gameplay.
Note: The code shared in this repository is for portfolio purposes only. The license status is pending.
